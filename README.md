## Introduction to Python

Python is a **high-level, interpreted, and general-purpose programming language** known for its simple syntax and readability. It was created by **Guido van Rossum** and first released in **1991**. Python emphasizes code clarity, making it an excellent choice for beginners as well as professionals.

Python is widely used in:

- Web Development
- Data Science & Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence

## How Python Works

Python code is executed line by line by the **Python Interpreter**.  
When a program is run:

1. The source code (`.py` file) is read
2. It is converted into bytecode
3. The Python Virtual Machine (PVM) executes it
