#A built in data type that lets us create immutable sequences of values
#list is mutable but strings and tuples are immutable
#list ma square bracket[] tara tuple ma paranthesis()
tup=(2,1,3,1)
print(tup[0])
print(tup[1])
print(type(tup))
#tup(2) is an integer whereas tup(2,) is a tuple
#tuple similarly has slicing as well ie print(tuple[3:2])
